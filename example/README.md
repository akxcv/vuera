## How to install `vuera_ts_lib`

 `cd..`

 `yarn install`

 `yarn build`

`yarn pack` -> check the name of the `*.tgz` file (in my case: `../vuera_ts_lib-v1.0.0-rc01.tgz` )

 `cd example`

 `yarn install`

`yarn add ../vuera_ts_lib-v1.0.0-rc01.tgz` -> already installs all it needs to run :)

 `yarn dev`
